# We want to version Output folders. This is so that Therion does not crash when trying to write to a non-existent folder.
# But we do NOT version their contents, subfolders, or content of subfolders, as this would bloat repository size for no benefit.
/**/outputs*/**

# Git cannot not track empty folders, and so we work around this by retaining a place holder .keepfolderifempty file in each empty folder that we want to be versioned.
# This next line cancels the ignore of files called .keepfolderifempty invoked by the above /**/Output*/** pattern.
!.keepfolderifempty
